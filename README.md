By this pet-project named as Pharmacy Manager i would like to present and demonstrate my current skills.
Inside the source You can find SQL file for DB initialization by name "StartSQLQueryForDB_Tables_Data_Creation.sql".
Just run this SQL in your db-app or change a little bit for init the db with tables and data. 
It will be necessary for correct data visualization inside the app.
Please note that pool of connections i used was on local machine.
db.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/pharmacydb

After running the app, firstly You will see the autentification form. There are two roles (admin/pharmacist).
Of course with different realization the functionality.

If there will be any issues, please let me know that i can update the code.

Thanks. It is my first project that i can pass to community=)
